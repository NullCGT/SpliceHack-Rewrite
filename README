                   SpliceHack 0.8.2 -- General information

SpliceHack is an in-progress fork of NetHack 3.7, made with the goal of adding
additional monsters, items, special levels, and game features without changing
too much of the core gameplay. The end goal is a "kitchen sink" variant similar
to SLASH'EM that is still intuitive and easy to pick up and play for anyone
familiar with vanilla NetHack.

Features:
- Monsters riding other monsters.
- The option to play as nonbinary and choose your orientation.
- Hundreds of new foes to fight.
- Dozens of new items to collect.
- An extended, more challenging endgame.
- So much more...

Suggestions and criticism of the game are welcome. This variant is very much a
work in progress, and as such bugs and balance issues may exist. Bug reports, 
suggestions for new features, questions, and pull requests can be directed 
to this variant's github page.

# How to Play:
- The latest stable SpliceHack release can be downloaded from https://github.com/NullCGT/SpliceHack/releases.
- SpliceHack is hosted online at https://www.hardfought.org.
- Advanced users can compile SpliceHack from the source using the same steps as one
  would use to compile NetHack 3.7.

# Configuration
For information about customizing NetHack, refer to https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Options.
The steps for customizing SpliceHack are the same as the steps for
customizing NetHack, except the file to edit is named .splicehackrc if you are
on a Unix system.

If you don't want to spend time writing a configuration file from scratch, this
repository contains a file named .splicehackrc.example for Unix systems. Simply
copy the file to the relevant location, rename it, and modify it to your heart's
content.

# Tileset
SpliceHack contains a tileset, and can be played in graphical or ascii mode depending
on the preference of the user.

A copy of this tileset is included for reference. Feel free to modify it or use it as
a basis for your own tilesets.

# Why the Rewrite?

When I started writing SpliceHack, I was not as opinionated or as trong of a developer
as I am now, and I had much less experience in balancing a game and making it fun to play.
This rewrite is an effort to improve both the code and the gameplay of SpliceHack, so 
that it is more enjoyable and easier to maintain.
