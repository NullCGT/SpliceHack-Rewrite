# BAB / Base Mana Regen

so i hate BAB in 3.5, because at level 1 everyone has basically the same odds to hit with weapons, but then as the game goes on, the lower-BAB (and lower skill point!) classes just become increasingly garbo at rolling dice, so they have to find ways to not roll for things, because rolling a d20 can often be a waste of their time.

BUT, if we are gonna have something similar to BAB, here are my thoughts *for nethack*:

## Zappers

These folks can *rely on their spells* completely. Basically this is anyone who has skill in Enchantment or Attack; you can use those schools to deal with most of the game. Zappers have very little need for additional skill trees; they can just go ham on spells to win.

Wizards, monks, maybe tou and arc, maybe even Knights.

I don't class Priests in this section because most of their spells are outta-combat or on an "as needed" basis.

Zappers should probably not have a high BAB, and they should have a decent BMR.

IMO, too many roles have "attack" spellcasting skill, make it more special by giving it to fewer roles.

## Skillies

These folks have utility spells to supplement their mundane skills. They should have a decent BAB and they don't need a ton of BMR. 

If a "wand skill" or "tool-user" skill gets added to the game, it should go to these folks!

Rogues, Rangers, Arcs.

## Armored Casters

These folks are a lot like skillies, not needing a lot of BMR but they will need to hit with attacks.

They should probably have a skill they can train into that reduces armor penalties, or improves shield AC.

Priests & Healers for sure, maybe Sam, maybe Kni, maybe Cav.

## Clonkers

These folks should mostly not be casting spells. They should have the best BAB and the worst BMB.

Barb, Valk.  Depending on how spellcasting penalties will work in Splice, Cav and Sam could go here too.

## Everything!!!

Monk and Tourist arguably are able to do it all. They fight, they cast in-combat spells, they cast outta-combat spells. Hard to fit into a category.
